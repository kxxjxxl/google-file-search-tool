 Gemini API enables Retrieval Augmented Generation ("RAG") through the File Search tool. File Search imports, chunks, and indexes your data to enable fast retrieval of relevant information based on a provided prompt. This information is then used as context to the model, allowing the model to provide more accurate and relevant answers.
